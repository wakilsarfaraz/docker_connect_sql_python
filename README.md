                      "Database=database_name;"
                      "Uid=username;Pwd=password;")

### Function: `write_dataframe_to_db`

Inserts rows from a pandas DataFrame into a specified database table.

and writes them to the specified table in the database.

Args:
    dataframe (pandas.DataFrame): The DataFrame containing the data to insert.
    table_name (str): The name of the database table to insert data into.
    connection_string (str): A valid database connection string used to connect to 
                             the database.

Logging:
    - Logs the start of the data insertion process.
    - Logs success after the data is written.
    - Logs errors encountered during execution.

Raises:
    Exception: If any error occurs while inserting data into the database.

Examples:
    >>> import pandas as pd
    >>> data = {'column1': [1, 2], 'column2': ['A', 'B']}

    >>> write_dataframe_to_db(df, "my_table", 
                              "Driver={ODBC Driver 18 for SQL Server};"
                              "Server=server_name;"

## file_operations.py

file_operations.py

This module provides utilities for handling file operations, specifically writing 
pandas DataFrames to local text files. 

Functions:
    - write_local_txt_output: Writes a pandas DataFrame to a text file in tab-delimited format.

Logging:
    - Logs the start and successful completion of file writing operations.
    - Logs errors encountered during file creation or writing.

Requirements:
    - pandas: Required for handling DataFrame operations.
    - os: For folder and file path manipulations.
    - logging: For logging operations and errors.

Usage:
    Import the `write_local_txt_output` function to save a DataFrame as a text file in a specified folder.

Example:
    >>> import pandas as pd
    >>> from file_operations import write_local_txt_output
    >>> data = {'Column1': [1, 2], 'Column2': ['A', 'B']}
    >>> df = pd.DataFrame(data)
    >>> write_local_txt_output(df, "output_folder", "output_file.txt")

### Function: `write_local_txt_output`

Writes a pandas DataFrame to a local text file in tab-delimited format.

This function ensures the target folder exists (creates it if necessary), then writes 
the given DataFrame to a text file with tab-separated values. The resulting file is saved 
in the specified folder with the provided file name.

Args:
    dataframe (pandas.DataFrame): The DataFrame to write to the text file.
    folder_path (str): The path to the folder where the file will be saved. If the folder 
                       does not exist, it will be created.
    file_name (str): The name of the text file to create.

Returns:
    str: The full path to the created file if the operation is successful.
    None: If an error occurs during the operation.

Logging:
    - Logs the start of the file writing process at the INFO level.
    - Logs the successful completion of the operation at the INFO level.
    - Logs any errors encountered during the operation at the ERROR level.

Raises:
    Exception: Logs any error that occurs during folder creation, file writing, or 
               DataFrame processing.

Examples:
    >>> import pandas as pd
    >>> data = {'Column1': [1, 2], 'Column2': ['A', 'B']}
    >>> df = pd.DataFrame(data)
    >>> write_local_txt_output(df, "output_folder", "output_file.txt")
    INFO: Starting to write DataFrame to text file: output_file.txt
    INFO: Processed data successfully written to output_folder/output_file.txt

Notes:
    - The file is written in tab-delimited format (`sep='   '`).
    - The index is not included in the output file (`index=False`).
    - Ensure the DataFrame contains valid data before calling this function.

## clear_folder.py

No module-level documentation available.

### Function: `clear_folder`

Clears the contents of a specified folder by deleting all files, subdirectories, 
and symbolic links within it.

This function recursively deletes all items inside the given folder path, including:
- Regular files
- Symbolic links
- Subdirectories and their contents

Args:
    folder_path (str): The path to the folder whose contents need to be cleared.

Logging:
    - Logs the start of the clearing process at the INFO level.
    - Logs a success message when the folder is cleared at the INFO level.
    - Logs any errors encountered during the process at the ERROR level.

Raises:
    Exception: If any error occurs while attempting to delete files, subdirectories, 
    or symbolic links.

Examples:
    >>> clear_folder("/path/to/directory")
    INFO: Starting to clear the contents of folder: /path/to/directory
    INFO: Contents of folder /path/to/directory have been cleared.

Note:
    - The function does not delete the folder itself, only its contents.
    - Ensure that the folder exists before calling this function. If the folder does not 
      exist, an error may be raised.
    - Use with caution as this action is irreversible.
