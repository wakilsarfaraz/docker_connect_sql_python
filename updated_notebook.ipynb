    "# Connecting to SQL Database using `pyodbc` Library in Python\n",
    "This notebook is a step-by-step guide to help you learn how to \n",
    "use Python functions and libraries to connect to an SQL database \n",
    "using the `pyodbc` library. Each section of the notebook includes \n",
    "an explanation of the code, which you can run in order to understand \n",
    "the workflow step by step.\n",
    "## Preparing the SQL Database\n",
    "Before using Python, we need to decide which SQL database to connect to. \n",
    "For this exercise, we will use the A Cloud Guru (ACG) sandbox to create an SQL database. \n",
    "Once the database is set up, we will obtain the necessary credentials to connect to it using Python. \n",
    "A detailed guide on how to create the SQL database in the ACG sandbox is available in a GitHub \n",
    "repository called [DE-sql-learning-environment-Azure](https://github.com/Corndel/DE-sql-learning-environment-Azure). \n",
    "Following the instructions provided in the repository from step **1 Create the ACG Sandbox for SQL learning** to step **4 Create tables in Azure SQL database and insert data**, by the completion of which you will have created an SQL database called **sakila**. We will need the **connection strings** for this database in order to be able to connect to it using Python library `pyodbc`. \n",
    "## Steps to Acquire the Connection Strings\n",
    "- Visit the SQL databases in the Azure portal (you can search for this service using the search \n",
    "box at the top and type SQL).\n",
    "\n",
    "![step-1](images/step1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "- In the list of databases that appears, click on the single database \n",
    "**sakila (sakilayaq6nqkx2fcqo/sakila)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "![step-2](images/step2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Click on **Settings** and then on **Connection Strings** in the drop down menu.\n",
    "\n",
    "![step-3](images/step3.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Go to the `ODBC`tab to see the connection string.\n",
    "\n",
    "![step-4](images/step4.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "- You will need to copy the underlined parts of the **Connection String** and store \n",
    "it somewhere safely to be used when running the pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "![step-5](images/step5.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Note that the password *{your_password_here}* is a placeholder within the connection strings, \n",
    "which needs to be replaced with the actual password of the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "- When running the pipeline you will be prompted to enter these three pieces of information:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Server name (the longest underlined part in the above screenshot, which you will be different \n",
    "    every time you create sakila). \n",
    "    * Username which for this database is **corndeladmin**.\n",
    "    * Passoword, which is **Password01**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Connecting to the **Sakila** Database and Creating an ETL Pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "This guide will walk you through the steps (using the `pyodbc` library) to connect to the \n",
    "SQL database we have just created. You will learn how to extract data from the database, manage \n",
    "tables within it, and write the processed data back into the database. Follow each step carefully \n",
    "to gain a clear understanding of how to build an ETL pipeline when you are using Python to work with \n",
    "SQL databases on virtual machines or on remote platforms online.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Python Libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. `pyodbc`\n",
    "It is a Python library for connecting to SQL databases using ODBC drivers. It allows \n",
    "communication between Python and SQL databases, making it essential for running SQL queries \n",
    "and managing database connections.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. `pandas`\n",
    "This is a Python library for data manipulation and analysis. It provides powerful \n",
    "tools to handle tabular data, such as reading, writing, and processing datasets extracted \n",
    "from the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. `os`\n",
    "This is a standard Python library for interacting with the operating system. \n",
    "It enables tasks like file and directory manipulation, crucial for managing input/output \n",
    "files during the ETL process.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. `shutil`\n",
    "It is a standard Python library for high-level file operations. It helps in efficiently \n",
    "clearing or organising folders by removing directories and their contents.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. `logging`\n",
    "This library is used for tracking events during code execution. It provides detailed \n",
    "logs for debugging and monitoring the ETL pipeline, ensuring transparency and easier \n",
    "troubleshooting.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6. `getpass`\n",
    "The `getpass` library in Python securely prompts the user for sensitive information, \n",
    "such as passwords, without displaying the input on the screen. It is ideal for creating \n",
    "secure, interactive command-line applications.\n",
